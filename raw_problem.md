A factory produces two types of food, I and II, and currently has 50 skilled workers. It is known that one skilled worker can produce 10  kg /  h of food I or 6  kg /  h of food II. According to contract bookings, the weekly demand for these two foods will rise sharply, as shown in Table 1-11. Therefore, the factory has decided to train 50 new workers by the end of the 8th week. It is known that a worker works 40  h per week, and a skilled worker can train up to three new workers in two weeks (during the training period, both the skilled worker and the trainees do not participate in production). The weekly wage of a skilled worker is 360 yuan, the weekly wage of a trainee during the training period is 120 yuan, and after training, the wage is 240 yuan per week, with the same production efficiency as skilled workers. During the transition period of training, many skilled workers are willing to work overtime, and the factory has decided to arrange some workers to work 60  h per week, with a weekly wage of 540 yuan. If the booked food cannot be delivered on time, the compensation fee for each week of delay per   kg is 0.5 yuan for food I and 0.6 yuan for food II. Under these conditions, how should the factory make comprehensive arrangements to minimize the total cost?

某工厂生产I、II两种食品，目前有50名熟练工人。已知1名熟练工人每小时可生产I类食品10公斤或II类食品6公斤。根据合同订单，这两种食品的每周需求量将大幅上升，具体情况如表1-11所示。因此，工厂决定在第8周末前培训50名新工人。已知工人每周工作40小时，1名熟练工人每两周最多可培训3名新工人（培训期间，该熟练工人与受训工人均不参与生产）。熟练工人的周工资为360元，受训工人在培训期间的周工资为120元，培训结束后周工资为240元，且生产效率与熟练工人相同。在培训过渡期，许多熟练工人愿意加班，工厂决定安排部分工人每周工作60小时，其周工资为540元。若已预订的食品未能按时交付，I类食品每公斤每周的延迟赔偿费为0.5元，II类食品每公斤每周的延迟赔偿费为0.6元。在此情况下，工厂应如何统筹安排以实现总成本最小化？
